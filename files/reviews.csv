I drove in to London so I can't say what the public transport is like getting here but driving, is not very far from the A2 if you're coming in from the East. Parked at the hotel, seemed secure and it was. Check in was fine. I would say customer service is excellent. The lady called 'Sahara' was very professional and helpful. The room was really awesome. I was worried at first by the window from the bathroom to the bedroom, but realised you could switch the glass on to cloud the window. I've had better sleeps, and the bed was ok, not great. Size was good but my back was a bit painful. The breakfast was very good. Lots of choice. The hotel at the rear offers views of the river and planes regularly fly over as it is near London City Airport. This was cool. I would stay here again."

The rooms are spacious for London, always very clean and stylish. The front desk personnel are professional and friendly. The hotel parking is a real plus if you are staying for business because it is conveniently located near the entrance to the Excel, and it not too expensive for the daily rate. The restaurant is nothing special and the fitness center is small and basically equipped, but otherwise I think the hotel is terrific. Will definitely be staying there again in the future."

There were smart devices for music etc, but the TV was a little confusing if you were searching for something.  The rain shower was fabulous - but an idea of how to change the temperature would be nice. We almost scalded ourselves whilst working it out. On the plus side, the water is really hot.  Breakfast seemed extrermely expensive, so we ate out.  The ironing board & iron was a great touch. The staff all seemed helpful, but not always easy to understand the accents.  The lack of parking was a downside for us, but Cornwall rd  underground parking was not too far away.  The lack of a well marked off loading point was a down side.  The hotel is nice and central and within walking distance of the London Eye etc.  The PWB Pub across the road has great food at reasonable prices too."

This is one of the only central London hotels that will accommodate a family of 4 in a non-suite style room.  I was not sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised with the stay. First and foremost, the hotel was pretty much full but our room was quiet and we were not once woken up by hallway or adjoining room noise. Furthermore, our two sons both had  cot-style beds in the room beside our Queen and all were more comfortable than I feared they might be.  Our towels were refreshed daily and there were no issues with any services during our stay. Additionally, breakfast was included in our rate and the Jamboree restaurant downstairs puts on a good spread each morning that will satisfy all tastes. This provided a great start to each day before we ventured out into the city. Overall, this hotel suited our purposes perfectly. A comfortable stay, friendly staff, and attentive service at a very good price. Also, I happen to love Southwark as a neighbourhood when I stay in London for work - a little less touristy but still very central to everything"

Particularly Kanisha at the front desk who not only recognized that it was my birthday but also had the turn down crew make my towels in the shape of a birthday cake and left the nicest birthday note.  This is not the type of service you would expect in most hotels in most major cities world wide.  To say I was pleasantly surprised would be an undersell.

We did not want to get separate hotel rooms and this was the only hotel I could find in central London that offered suite accommodations of 2 bedrooms with 2 baths.  We also took advantage of the breakfast package which included a daily breakfast either in the dining room or via room service.  Since we had a suite, the room service breakfast was perfect, served right in our room, and offered us more time to prepare for our days of sightseeing.  We found everything beyond our expectations and were ready to stay at the end of our week long visit.  Also, the concierge desk staff helped guide us through our stay which made travelling much easier. Our 2 bedroom, 2 bath suite with terrace was on the 13th floor and offered everything we could have hoped for.  We look forward to returning someday! Finally, we found the location to be ideal.  A bit quieter than the usual touristy sections while still close walking distance to many sights, the Big Bus Hop On Hop Off, the underground and Waterloo Train Station which we used for a day trip to Windsor."

The hotel is in a reasonable location, with a few bars and restaurants close bar, nearest tube 5 - 10 minutes walk away. Again once we checked out we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel, which enabled us to make the most of our stay."

On  our last visit we stayed in a Hub with barely enough room to move. This time I found this hotel at a remarkable price, really, and decided to try it. The room was in the basement. Very little natural light. It was a reasonable size with all the usual facilities. It was clean and very functional and much better than a Hub. The area, Bayswater, is fantastic. It has absolutely everything you need right on your doorstep, and excellent transport links. We really did London extremely cheaply, using this hotel, and eating from the many outlets on our doorstep, and had a fantastic time. We even managed to get £6 train tickets from Rugby station to Euston, and use our bus passes to get around. That just about made up for the cost of the tickets to see Hamilton. Another story."

Absolutely no room for anything else and the room was directly opposite the lift.  Every single noise was heard and the bed was the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in. So lumpy and hard, if you have a back condition (which I do), you can't sleep well at all.  The breakfast was very mediocre and not worth the extra we paid for it.  I would not stay there again."

My room was for a solo traveler and I can only imagine it must have served a butler or lady’s maid in the past. I was happy to enjoy the deep bathtub and view over the fall treetops of the park even if the room was small. I took the staircase every time with its carved wood bannister and the bronze dragon that is the twin of the one from the Titanic staircase.  For practical purposes, the tube is next door, as well as a small mini mart and a coffee shop that has grab-and-go sandwiches.  A wonderful choice. I would pop in for a meal, tea, or a cocktail at least if you  enjoy historic hotels. "

There was around 2-3 feet of space around the bed, and when the ironing board was out, you couldn't move at all. The bathroom was stunning. A staff member tried to turn me away from breakfast because they were too busy. I went in anyway and easily found a table. They just didn't want a single diner occupying a table of four."

I am a regular guest at the Hilton London Canary Wharf, and I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  The close proximity to London City Airport (10 min by taxi, with subway options also available) and relatively cheaply (GBP15-20 by taxi, cheaper by ""Tube"") is a big draw-card for me, for business travel. Similarly, close proximity to two London Tube stations thus providing access to the entire London subway network, is very convenient.  The spacious executive lounge has an appropriate selection of drinks and treats available. The staff throughout, from check-in/reception, to concierge, to executive lounge mangers, are all fantastic, and highly efficient, friendly, and professional. The rooms are clean, and I usually try for a Junior Suite, which is wonderfully spacious, and very well appointed, with large windows, and amenities that include a fridge, as well as tea and coffee station.

Hotel lobby look modern and stylish, staffs here are very friendly and always willing to help.  Room was a bit small but still feel okay for two person with comfortable stay. One thing we felt not so convenient was no kettle in the room for tea or hot water even though you can asked for hot water in the lobby coffee bar.  In addition, they will charge 3 pounds for luggage storage which might not happen in other hotels."

The Tower,Rachel T,35-49,woman,"Henley-on-Thames, United",3,19 November 2018,Next door to the Tower of London,"November 2018, travelled as a couple","Second time staying here and probably won't be repeated.  I booked it for an anniversary weekend with my husband and we were visiting the Tower of London as part of our weekend.  The location for the Tower of London is great - barely a 10 minute walk to the entrance.  Breakfast was very well handled for the volume of people staying at the hotel - lots of choice and replenishing of items was very quick.  Our room however was a real let down.  Two single beds, a very small room and a very tired bathroom which really lacked some of those essential amenities.  "

It is so convenient to have such a wonderful value for money, spotlessly clean hotel a mere two minute walk from Kings Cross & st Pancras. The staff are young, lively, professional and efficient. Easy to book in and out. I wouldn’t stay anywhere else. Central to all London amenities via overhead train, underground and bus service. This hotel is perfect. The low cost for central London is a huge added bonus."

Crowne Plaza London Kensington,chiqui-7,35-49,woman,"Lucerne,",5,13 October 2018,Great Hotel Best Location ,"October 2018, travelled with family","I selected the Crown Plaza after looking at many reviews. We were not disappointed. The hotel has a great location near the tube station and high streets. The outside of the building is a lovely white Victorian building but inside is modern and stylish. Reception and concierge is efficient and friendly, easy check in and out. The breakfast buffet was plentiful, I really loved the smoothie of the day. The service here was also friendly and competent. The room was modern and comfortable with an excellent bathroom and everything working. We had a room facing the inside garden and was totally quiet, even if we opened the window you can not hear any traffic. Housekeeping was excellent , the room was serviced as we went out and looked amazing on return.  There is a lovely outside garden and restaurant at the back of the property, it’s very relaxing to sit outside. It was a great base for our visit to London and I can recommend it with confidence."
Crowne Plaza London Kensington,M O,,,"London, United",5,19 November 2018,Excellent proerty with a great location and super service from staff!,"November 2018, travelled with family",It's hard to beat the Crowne Plaza Hotel Kensington. The location is great as it's only a one minute walk to the tube station; buses stop right outside the hotel door and the staff and concierge goes beyond the norm to assist you. The hotel got us the exact room we requested with a smile on their face. Breakfast at the lounge was good as well.     We stay at the Crowne Plaza Hotel Kensington every time we visit London and we wouldn't stay anywhere else. You should too!
The Nadler Soho,S K,,Man,,5,11 November 2018,Great Location/Price Soho London,"October 2018, travelled as a couple","Stayed here 4 nights in September-October. Great location, nice , well kept rooms. Contemporary feel. Views aren't great, surrounded by buildings, but walk-able area, not far from Oxford St. and plenty of shopping. Nice park not far from front. Many places to eat near by. A bunch of bars in alley in front of hotel, but we never had an issue. Comfortable bed, plenty of pillows, and very quiet. Temperature control in room seemed to actually do something. Nice sized bathroom, clean. Room was decent size but not huge-one of those rooms you have a few feet on all sides of the bed. Our room had a kitchenette that was usable-though you had to sit on the bed to use it. Staff was great and responsive. Would go back."
The Nadler Soho,belindareiser,,,,3,16 November 2018,"Great location, hotel over-rated","November 2018, travelled on business","This hotel is in a fantastic location for shopping and Soho area.  But the hotel was very disappointing.  The lobby was nice, and staff pleasant and helpful. The room was small, but as expected. The bathroom was nice, but the bed and bedding left a lot to be desired.  Very hard bed, and bedding was a very cheap duvet and foam pillow, with rough sheets.  I had a basement room and the hall way was dingy and in need of painting.  The basement room also smelled musty.  The worst problem was the bed was right up against the window and the cord for the blind had come unattached from the wall and was hanging over the bed.  A clear safety issue, especially if small children were in the room.  I did report this and I'm sure it was taken care of, but this is right over the bed so really should have been noticed by housekeeping as they were changing sheets and taken care of prior to my arrival.  This could be a nice a hotel if they just upgraded the bed and bedding."

Its location is great. The welcome warm and friendly. The room was clean, quiet and comfortable. Everything you would expect from a hotel but what makes this hotel stand out is the little things. On arrival, having spent a long time in the car thanks to a protest, we were very thirsty, so the complimentary bottle of water offered at check in was very welcome. As a tea drinker, the fresh milk for the fridge in the room was another plus. The complimentary snacks were not just any snacks but quality - Blacks chocolate, flapjack, crisps and cans of coke. Wifi without a code, slippers, good quality bathroom products, the list goes on. We had a fabulous nights sleep and wouldn't hesitate to stay again next time we are in London."

The bathroom was in our room also a bit average, but it was clean though and that is the most important. I found it a bit to expensive for what we got, bit maybe we just had a bit of bad luck. "

The Grosvenor Hotel,Sharon M,50-64,woman,"Rugby, United",5,20 November 2018,Great hotel,"November 2018, travelled as a couple","We stayed at the Grosvenor Victoria to attend a trip on the Belmond Pullman. The hotel was absolutely stunning, the architecture was amazing. On arrival a little disappointed that they didn't have a doorman, which is unusual for London's larger hotels. However the staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough to help. We booked in and our room was very nice. We had the accessible room, which was excellent. Plenty of room to move around and a wet room that was very easy to use. We ate at lunch time in the restaurant and it was good food, reasonably priced for London and plentiful. We didn't bother with breakfast as still full from our dinner the night before. Hotel was very clean. We had room at the back of the hotel overlooking the station, and we were amazed at how quitet it was. We had a great night's sleep and the bed was very comfortable. All in all a great hotel and a good stay. We will be returning and have booked for next year when we go on our cruise."

Excellent breakfast (did not take dinner). Room clean, tidy & comfortable. (only a short walk from the lift). bathroom was adequate for me but could have been seen has a little too small if 2 people were using it. The room was full of everything you might want including ironing board & iron. My stay was enjoyable & met what I needed., although I should consider what I paid for 2 nights, should have included breakfast."
